## 📂 Repository Structure

- **HLD/**  
  Contains **High-Level Designs** of systems with architecture diagrams, data flow, scaling strategies, and trade-offs.

- **LLD/**  
  Contains **Low-Level Designs** focusing on class diagrams, database schema, API contracts, and design patterns.

- **Projects/**  
  Hands-on implementations of selected designs to connect **theory with practice**.  
  Example: URL Shortener, Chat App, E-commerce Backend.
